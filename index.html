    <p class="text-muted">Church and school are two of the biggest parts of my life. My first memories are going to church and school, because that is all I’ve ever focused on. I don’t play sports, so I spend my free nights after school and weekends studying for tests and going to church.  My summers consist of working and volunteering in church programs. </p>

Almost every nation has a football team, and they have a huge fan following. There are many football tournaments held on national as well as international levels.

            We can judge how famous the game is by seeing the crowd’s enthusiasm and craze watching a match of their favorite team playing. It is believed that the game was invented in England around the mid-19th century, but there exists controversy as the Chinese claim that they had invented the game.
